### Summary
This Codebook is constructed to provide additional information of the Getting and Cleaning
Course project that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations/work performed
to clean up the dataset provided by [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) webpage.

The original source data can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). It is then unzipped and saved to the Course project folder
and used for further R cleaning analysis.
